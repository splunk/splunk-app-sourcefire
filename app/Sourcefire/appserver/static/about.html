<h3>Welcome to Splunk for Sourcefire</h3>
<p>The Splunk for Sourcefire App includes an eStreamer client that will connect to
your eStreamer server (e.g. Defense Center) and pull intrusion event records and
packet records (pcap data) into Splunk. Then you can search through eStreamer
records based on source or destination IP addresses, ports, event ID, and etc.
</p>
<p>By default, the app will not try to pull the packet records (pcap data) from the
eStreamer server. You can enable the pcap input by editing inputs.conf:</p>
    <code>$ vi $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Sourcefire/default/inputs.conf</code>

<p>Change the line that says "disabled = true" to "disabled = false" like the following:</p>
    <code>
    [script://$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Sourcefire/bin/estreamer_pcap.py]<br />
    disabled = false<br />
    interval = 60<br />
    source = estreamer_pcap.py<br />
    sourcetype = estreamer_pcap<br />
    </code>
<p>Then restart the Splunk server.</p>
<br />
<p>NOTE: It may take up to 5 minutes for new data to show up. 
The app relies on "sourcetype = estreamer" and "sourcetype = estreamer_pcap" data, please do not change the sourcetype in inputs.conf.</p>
